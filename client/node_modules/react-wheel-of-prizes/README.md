This component package is fully configurable. you should pass your own array of seg_colors, array of segments. these are compulsory while winning_segment is optional. if it is not provided then it will be completely random. there is a callback function onFinished where you will get the winning segment.

Also if you want to match with your theme, you can provide primary, contrast color and also the button text. these all are optional.

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
